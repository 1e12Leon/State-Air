# State-Air Dataset 

In Paper 'Scale-Invariant Feature Disentanglement via Adversarial Learning for UAV-based Object Detection' we constructed a multi-scene and multi-modal UAV-based object detection  dataset, State-Air. It was captured in a real-world outdoor setting with a wide variety of scenes and weather conditions. We are committed to further enhancing the scope and scale of State-Air, expanding both the coverage and depth of it.
